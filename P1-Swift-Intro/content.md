Download the _Swift Playground_ [here](https://github.com/MakeSchool-Tutorials/Swift-Language-Playgrounds/archive/master.zip). _Playgrounds_ are interactive coding environments that can contain instructions. You can think of it as a textbook you can code in!

Go through the playground and you'll get a great introduction to a bunch of programming concepts in _Swift_, including:

1. `var` vs. `let`
1. Types
1. Strings
1. Optionals
1. Arrays
1. Dictionaries
1. Tuples
1. Control flow
1. Functions
1. Classes and structs
1. Initializers
1. Type (static) properties
